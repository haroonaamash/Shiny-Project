# Shiny-Project

In this project, I have attempted to show how the real estate market in new york has been over a period of 13 years.
By visualizing the mean transaction volume as well as the median transaction price per borough over a 13 years helps visualize 
what the RE market has been through over time and where majority of the transactions have moved. I have also tried to 
introduce more variables such as size of property, ranging from one family to three family houses as well as tried to give 
neighborhood specefic data for all 5 boroughs.

All data has been retrieved from nyc.gov
